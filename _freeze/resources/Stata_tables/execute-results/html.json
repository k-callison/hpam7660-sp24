Much of the information in this guide was drawn from Asjad Naqvi's \"[The Stata-to-LaTex guide](https://medium.com/p/6e7ed5622856)\" published on Medium. \n\n### The Setup\n\n*STATA*\n\nTo create LaTeX tables in STATA, you'll need to install the `estout` package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nssc install estout, replace\n```\n:::\n\n\nIf you already have the `estout` package installed, make sure that you're using the latest version.\n\n*LaTeX*\n\nYou'll also need some way to compile LaTeX files. Overleaf is probably the most commonly used compiler, though you could also download a compiler, like TeXLive to your computer. I recommend Overleaf because it stores all of your projects online and makes for easy collaboration.\n\nYou'll need to add the following packages to your LaTeX preamble in order to compile the tables in this guide. These packages need to be added *in addition* to any other packages you need to compile your document.\n\n![](/img/latex_preamble.png){fig-alt=\"Latex Preamble\"}\n\n### Summary Statistics Tables\n\nRun the following STATA code that will load an example data set, tabulate some basic summary statistics, and stores the results in STATA's `e()` matrices.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsysuse census, clear\n  foreach i of varlist pop-popurban death-divorce {\n    replace `i' = `i' / 1000\n  }\n\nest clear\nestpost tabstat pop pop65p medage death marriage divorce, c(stat) stat(sum mean sd min max n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we can use the `esttab` command, which is part of the `estout` package, to generate a summary statistics table. We'll start with a basic table and add additional elements as we go.\n\n*Basic*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nesttab using \"~/table_1a.tex\", replace cells(\"sum mean sd min max count\") booktabs\n```\n:::\n\n\nYou should replace the \"~\" with your desired path for file storage. You'll probably want to set this path at the beginning of your .do file using a global. \n\nOnce you've generated the `table_1a.tex` file, you can upload it into your Overleaf document and add the following code to display the table:\n\n![](/img/tab1a.png){fig-alt=\"table_1a\"}\n\nThis code tells LaTeX that we're placing a table in the document and that the table should use the `table_1a.tex` file for its input. The `!htbp` command helps with table positioning. The exclamation point overrides some LaTeX defaults and may not be appropriate to use in all cases. If you're struggling to get the table to display in a propor position in the document, try removing the exclamation point. The `\\centering` command tells LaTeX to put the table in the center of the page and the `\\caption` command allows us to add a title to the table. Note that you could also add a title using the options in STATA's `esttab` command, but it's better to do this in the LaTeX document. Finally, the `label` command allows us to add a label to the table that we can reference throughout our LaTeX document. It's always better to refer to something like \"Table \\\\ref{tab:ss_basic}\" instead of \"Table 1a\" in your LaTeX document. That way, if the table order changes, it updates automatically in your document.\n\nBy default, LaTeX will include the subsection number in the table number, so you'll get something like \"Table 1.1\". To drop the subsection number, you can add the following command to your LaTeX preamble: `\\renewcommand{\\thetable}{\\arabic{table}}`.\n\nYou'll see that this table contains the sum, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and observation count for six variables in the census data set. This looks pretty good, but there are some elements that aren't quite right. For example, the table has only once column number for six columns and it contains the number of observations as both a column and row at the bottom. We can clean this up by adding the following options to the `esttab` command in STATA:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nesttab using \"/Users/kevin2/Desktop/tables/table_1b.tex\", replace cells(\"sum mean sd min max count\") /// \nbooktabs nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs label\n```\n:::\n\n\nAdd this new table to your LaTeX document like this:\n\n![](/img/tab1b.png){fig-alt=\"table_1b\"}\nThe `vspace{0.5in}` command adds a half inch of blank space between the two tables. It's not necessary, but makes things look better in this case.\n\nOur table is looking better now. We got rid of the column numbering and the extra observation count. But there are still improvements that we could make. For example, suppose that we don't need all these decimal places in each column. We can adjust that by formatting the column output in the `esttab` command as follows. Let's also clean up some of the column names while we're at it:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nesttab using \"/Users/kevin2/Desktop/tables/table_1c.tex\", replace /// \ncells(\"sum(fmt(%7.0fc)) mean(fmt(%6.2fc)) sd(fmt(%6.2fc)) min max count\") /// \nbooktabs nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs label ///\ncollabels(\"Sum\" \"Mean\" \"SD\" \"Min\" \"Max\" \"Obs\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThis looks good, but oftentimes we want summary statistics tables that compare characteristics for a treatment group and a control group. Run the following STATA code that designates certain states in the census data as \"treated\" states and the others as \"control states\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ngen treat=1 if inlist(state, \"Louisiana\", \"Texas\", \"Arkansas\", \"Mississippi\")\nreplace treat=0 if treat==.\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow run the following `estpost` and modified `esttab` commands that will generate a treatment vs. control summary statistics LaTeX table. Note that, for this table, we'll focus on the mean and the standard deviation of the variables of interest and present the information in the more standard format of estimate over the standard deviation.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nest clear\nestpost tabstat pop pop65p medage death marriage divorce, by(treat) c(stat) stat(mean sd) nototal\n\nesttab using \"/Users/kevin2/Desktop/tables/table_1d.tex\", replace /// \ncells(\"mean(fmt(%8.2fc))\" \"sd(par)\") /// \nbooktabs nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs label unstack compress gap ///\ncollabels(none) eqlabels(\"Treatment\" \"Control\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nOne thing to note here is that we're using `eqlables` rather than `collabels` to add column labels. This is because when we use the `by()` option in the `estpost` command, the STATA output is stacked in one long column. We use the `unstack` option to split the summary statistics by treatment and control groups, and when we do this, STATA treats each column as an \"equation\". \n\nAnother thing to be aware of is that we're using the `sd(par)` option to put the standard errors in parentheses under the mean values. When we do this, any formatting that we use for the mean (e.g., %8.2fc) is passed on to the standard deviation.  \n\n\n",
