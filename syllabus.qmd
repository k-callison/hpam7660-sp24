### Course Descripton

HPAM 7660 presents an overview of health policy in the United States – its scope, its dynamics, and its conceptual and practical dilemmas. The course is designed to acquaint students with major issues in the policymaking process, specifically in formulating, implementing, and assessing those patterns of government decision. Students will explore the history and structure of the American health care system, as well as explore a policy issue of their choosing using the Bardach analytical method.

### Course Materials

We will use the following online (and free!) textbook along with various readings that will be posted to the course website under the Assignments tab.

- Ismay, Chester and Albert Y. Kim. 2022. [*Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse*](https://moderndive.com/index.html). 

We'll use R in this class to conduct data analysis. R is free,  open source, and available on all
major platforms. [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) (also free) is a graphical interface to R that is widely used to work with the R language. R is available in all Tulane computer labs and you are encouraged to bring your laptop to class if you're able to. [Problem Set 0][ps0] will walk you through setting up with R, RStudio, and GitHub. 


### Course Evaluation

The following components and weights will be used to calculate your final grade:

| Category      | Percent of Final Grade |
|:-------------------|:-------------------|
| Class participation   | 10%                    |
| Reading Discussion Questions & Problem Sets  | 40%                    |
| Policy Memo         | 30%                    |
| Case Presentation | 20%                    |
| Peer Assessment | 25% |


*Policy Memo* - throughout the semester, you will construct a policy memo to be submitted on the final day of class. The memo should advocate for a policy position of your choice and can be targeted to local leaders (e.g., mayor, city council, etc.), or state or federal legislators. The target audience will depend on the scope of your policy. The final draft of the policy memo should be approximately 8-10 pages, excluding references.

The University of Southern California library provides a good [guide](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/assignments/policymemo) for writing a policy memo. Note that as the guide states: “You should not approach writing a policy memo in the same way as you would an academic research paper. Yes, there are certain commonalities in how the content is presented [e.g., a well-written problem statement], but the overarching objective of a policy memo is not to discover or create new knowledge. It is focused on providing a pre-determined group of readers the rationale for choosing a particular policy alternative or specific course of action. In this sense, most policy memos possess a component of advocacy and advice intended to promote evidence-based dialog about an issue.”
Your policy memo will consist of the following 7 sections, that will be submitted individually throughout the semester before a final version of the memo to be submitted on the last day of class:

1.	Executive summary\
2.	Introduction and problem definition (Bardach Step 1)\
3.	Issue analysis (Bardach Step 2)\
4.	Proposed solutions (Bardach Steps 3, 4, & 5)\  
5.	Strategic recommendations (Bardach Step 6 & Step 7)\
6.	Conclusion (Bardach Step 8)\
7.	References\

Policy Memo Due Dates:

1.	Problem statement – Feb. 28th\ 
2.	Preliminary reference list – March 14th\  
3.	Introduction and problem definition draft – March 21st\  
4.	Issue analysis draft – March 28th\
5.	Proposed solutions draft – April 11th\   
6.	Strategic recommendations draft – April 25th\ 
7.	Executive summary and conclusions draft – May 2nd\  
8.	Final draft & Infographic – May 9th\ 

*Case Presentation* - The case presentation will take place on May 2nd. The case presentation will coincide with a series of panel discussion during our “virtual D.C. experience”. I’ll provide more detail on the schedule and content of these panels on the course website along with a rubric for the case presentations.

*Reading Discussion Questions & Problem Sets* – Reading discussion questions will be due by class time each Tuesday afternoon and should be submitted through Canvas. I will post the reading discussion questions to Canvas at least a week in advance of the due date.  

*Peer Assessment* - The peer assessment component of your grade will consist of anonymous grading of your team contribution by the other members of your team (more specific details to follow).

Your final course grade will be calculated according to the following ranges:

| Letter Grade      | Percentage |
|:-----------|:---------------------------|
| A  | 94% and above                    |
| A- | 90 to 93.9%                    |
| B+ | 85 to 89.9%                |
| B  | 80 to 84.9%                    |
| B- | 75 to 79.9% |
| C  | 70 to 74.9% |
| F  | <70% |

### Late Policy

Late submissions will be given half credit.

### SPHTM Honor Code

I expect that you will abide by the school’s Honor Code and Code of Academic Conduct. Failure to do so will result in referral to the Honor Board. I encourage you to discuss the lectures and coursework with your colleagues to facilitate your understanding of the material. But I expect that you will engage in independent scholarship when completing your own work, properly citing external assistance or sources. If you have any questions about these expectations, please refer to the code or ask me in advance. 

### Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990

It is the policy and practice of Tulane University to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (Pub. L. No. 101-336), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L.
