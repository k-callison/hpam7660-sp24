### Course Descripton

The primary aim of this course is to present an overview of health policy in American government, its scope, dynamics, and conceptual and practical dilemmas. It is designed to acquaint students with major issues involved in formulating, implementing, and assessing patterns of decisions established by government. Because the study of policy is essentially interdisciplinary, readings for the course have been drawn from several fields, including sociology, political science, and economics. Specific areas of consideration will be addressed during the seminar through analysis and discussion of the functions of state and local government and various stakeholder groups that attempt to influence governmental action.

### Prerequisites

Open to graduate students.

### Learning Objectives

After completing this course, students will be able to do the following:

1. Exhibit a conceptual understanding of the forces and factors accounting for legislation and regulation pertaining to     health services.\
2. Develop a framework to critically discuss and evaluate policy issues affecting the U.S. health care system.\
3. Compare and contrast the public policy objectives of various stakeholders with the realities of the political            process.\
4. Critically evaluate the research literature that examines the federal and state roles in health services.\
5. Evaluate current proposals advanced in Congress and by the private sector that impact health services delivery.\
6. Demonstrate a working understanding of the legislative process and the related federal and state regulation              processes.\

### Course Materials

#### Required Materials

We will use the following online (and free!) textbook along with various readings that will be posted to the course website under the Assignments tab.

-   Ismay, Chester and Albert Y. Kim. 2022. [*Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse*](https://moderndive.com/index.html).

We'll use R in this class to conduct data analysis. R is free, open source, and available on all major platforms. [RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com) (also free) is a graphical interface to R that is widely used to work with the R language. R is available in all Tulane computer labs and you are encouraged to bring your laptop to class if you're able to. \[Problem Set 0\]\[ps0\] will walk you through setting up with R, RStudio, and GitHub.

#### Recommended Materials

If you're new to health care institutions in the U.S. and the mechanics of federal and state policymaking, this text may be helpful:

Barr, D. *Introduction to US Health Policy: The Organization, Financing, and Delivery of Health Care in America*, 4th Edition. ISBN-13: 978-1421420721

### Description of Required Assignments:

*Policy Memo* - throughout the semester, you will construct a policy memo to be submitted on the final day of class. The memo should advocate for a policy position of your choice and can be targeted to local leaders (e.g., mayor, city council, etc.), or state or federal legislators. The target audience will depend on the scope of your policy. The final draft of the policy memo should be approximately 8-10 pages, excluding references.

The University of Southern California library provides a good [guide](https://libguides.usc.edu/writingguide/assignments/policymemo) for writing a policy memo. Note that as the guide states: “You should not approach writing a policy memo in the same way as you would an academic research paper. Yes, there are certain commonalities in how the content is presented \[e.g., a well-written problem statement\], but the overarching objective of a policy memo is not to discover or create new knowledge. It is focused on providing a pre-determined group of readers the rationale for choosing a particular policy alternative or specific course of action. In this sense, most policy memos possess a component of advocacy and advice intended to promote evidence-based dialog about an issue.” Your policy memo will consist of the following 7 sections, that will be submitted individually throughout the semester before a final version of the memo to be submitted on the last day of class:

1.  Executive summary\
2.  Introduction and problem definition (Bardach Step 1)\
3.  Issue analysis (Bardach Step 2)\
4.  Proposed solutions (Bardach Steps 3, 4, & 5) 
5.  Strategic recommendations (Bardach Step 6 & Step 7)\
6.  Conclusion (Bardach Step 8)\
7.  References\

Policy Memo Due Dates:

1.  Problem statement – Feb. 29th 
2.  Preliminary reference list – March 14th 
3.  Introduction and problem definition draft – March 21st 
4.  Issue analysis draft – April 4th\
5.  Proposed solutions draft – April 11th \
6.  Strategic recommendations draft – April 25th 
7.  Executive summary and conclusions draft – May 2nd 
8.  Final draft – May 9th 

*Case Presentation* - The case presentation will take place on May 2nd. The case presentation will coincide with a series of panel discussion during our “virtual D.C. experience”. I’ll provide more detail on the schedule and content of these panels on the course website along with a rubric for the case presentations.

*Reading Discussion Questions & Problem Sets* – Reading discussion questions and problem sets will be due by class time one their assigned date. These will typically be submitted through GitHub, though some of the submissions early in the semester will use Canvas.

*Peer Assessment* - The peer assessment component of your grade will consist of anonymous grading of your team contribution by the other members of your team (more specific details to follow).


### Attendance Policy

Class attendance is a critical component of learning, and students are expected to attend and participate fully in all scheduled class meetings and activities. While there is no specific attendance grade in the course, class absences will reflect negatively on student participation scores. Students are responsible for notifying instructors and the Office of Student Experience about significant absences that result from serious illnesses, injuries, or critical personal problems. Students experiencing barriers to meeting attendance requirements due to disabilities are encouraged to register with the Goldman Center for Student Accessibility to discuss accommodation and to make the necessary arrangements with their instructor.

### ADA/Accessibility Statement

Tulane University is committed to offering classes that are accessible. If you anticipate or encounter disability-related barriers in a course, please contact the [Goldman Center for Student Accessibility](https://accessibility.tulane.edu/) to establish reasonable accommodations. If approved by Goldman, make arrangements with me as soon as possible to discuss your accommodation so that they may be implemented in a timely fashion. I will never ask for medical documentation from you to support potential accommodation needs.

### Student Code of Academic Content

Students are required to adhere to the Unified Code of Graduate Student Academic Conduct, available online [here](https://ogps.tulane.edu/sites/default/files/Unified%20Code%20of%20Graduate%20Student%20Academic%20Conduct%20-%202024%20Final%20(1).pdf).

Each student enrolled in the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine has the responsibility to read, understand and follow the code of academic conduct. Lack of knowledge of code or its application does not constitute an excuse for non-compliance.  Tulane University expects and requires behavior compatible with its high standards of scholarship. By accepting admission to the university, a student accepts its regulations and acknowledges the right of the university to take disciplinary action.

### Artificial Intelligence Policy

There are no restrictions on the use of AI in this course. Use of AI tools such as ChatGPT are encouraged for class writing assignments (e.g., policy memo sections). However, you should note that these tools are unlikely to generate high quality work on their own. The best use of these tools involves editing and refining draft materials that you have written yourself.  

### Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion (EDI) Statement

Equity, diversity, and inclusion (EDI) are important [Tulane values](https://president.tulane.edu/core-values) that are key drivers of academic excellence in our learning environments. In our drive for academic excellence, we seek to ensure that students, faculty, and staff across diverse social identities, cultural backgrounds, and lived experiences can thrive – especially those from underrepresented and underserved communities (e.g., race/ethnicity, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, social class, international, veterans, religious minorities, age, and any other classification protected by applicable law - see [Tulane's Nondiscrimination Policy](https://tulane.app.box.com/s/w96x9akgbfp1oq3f5po5onzmus9tkdsi)). To build a supportive culture and climate for every member of our community, we recognize that we each have unique EDI strengths to share with others and that we also have areas for EDI growth, learning, and change. This EDI commitment and cultural humility helps us collectively build a university community and culture where everyone experiences belonging.

### Religious Accomodation Policy

Per Tulane’s [religious accommodation policy](https://registrar.tulane.edu/academic-calendars/religious-observance-policy), I will make every reasonable effort to ensure that students are able to observe religious holidays without jeopardizing their ability to fulfill their academic obligations. Excused absences do not relieve the student from the responsibility for any course work required during the period of absence. Students should notify me within the first two weeks of the semester about their intent to observe any holidays that fall on a class day or on the day of the final exam.


### Title IX

Tulane University recognizes the inherent dignity of all individuals and promotes respect for all people. As such, Tulane is committed to providing an environment free of all forms of discrimination including sexual and gender-based discrimination, harassment, and violence like sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and stalking.
