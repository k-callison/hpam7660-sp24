title: "February 29th Assignments"
---

There are two assignments due on February 29th (Sorry!). One is the third data assignment, which you'll submit through a GitHub repo like you have with the other data assignments. The second is the problem statement draft, which you'll submit through Canvas by clicking on the link below. 

Remember, the problem statement should be one or two sentences that defines the problem you'll address in the policy memo. See the [slides from January 25th](/slides/HPAM_7660_Bardach_Overview.pdf) for tips on constructing your problem statement.
