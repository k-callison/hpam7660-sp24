## Exporting STATA Tables to LaTeX and Word

This guide will cover the basics of exporting summary statistics and regression coefficients from STATA to formatted tables in LaTeX and Word. Much of the information in this guide was drawn from Asjad Naqvi's "[The Stata-to-LaTex guide](https://medium.com/p/6e7ed5622856)" published on Medium. 

### The Setup

*STATA*

To create LaTeX tables in STATA, you'll need to install the `estout` package.

```{r eval = FALSE}
ssc install estout, replace
```

If you already have the `estout` package installed, make sure that you're using the latest version.

*LaTeX*

You'll also need some way to compile LaTeX files. Overleaf is probably the most commonly used compiler, though you could also download a compiler, like TeXLive to your computer. I recommend Overleaf because it stores all of your projects online and makes for easy collaboration.

You'll need to add the following packages to your LaTeX preamble in order to compile the tables in this guide. These packages need to be added *in addition* to any other packages you need to compile your document.

*Word*

There is no setup to do in Word. We'll export STATA tables to .rtf files and you can open these files directly in Word.

### Summary Statistics Tables

Run the following STATA code that will load an example data set, tabulate some basic summary statistics, and stores the results in STATA's `e()` matrices.

```{r eval = FALSE}
sysuse census, clear
  foreach i of varlist pop-popurban death-divorce {
    replace `i' = `i' / 1000
  }

est clear
estpost tabstat pop pop65p medage death marriage divorce, c(stat) stat(sum mean sd min max n)
```

Now we can use the `esttab` command, which is part of the `estout` package, to generate a summary statistics table. We'll start with a basic table and add additional elements as we go.

*LaTeX*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/table_1a.tex", replace cells("sum mean sd min max count") booktabs
```

*Word*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/tables.rtf", replace /// 
cells("sum mean sd min max count") title("Table 1: Summary statistics - Basic")
```

You should replace the "~" with your desired path for file storage. You'll probably want to set this path at the beginning of your .do file using a global. 

Once you've generated the `table_1a.tex` file, you can upload it into your Overleaf document and add the following code to display the table:

![](/img/tab1a.png){fig-alt="table_1a"}

This code tells LaTeX that we're placing a table in the document and that the table should use the `table_1a.tex` file for its input. The `!htbp` command helps with table positioning. The exclamation point overrides some LaTeX defaults and may not be appropriate to use in all cases. If you're struggling to get the table to display in a proper position in the document, try removing the exclamation point. The `\centering` command tells LaTeX to put the table in the center of the page and the `\caption` command allows us to add a title to the table. Note that you could also add a title using the `title` option in STATA's `esttab` command. We'll do this for our Word tables, but when using LaTeX, it's better to add titles in the LaTeX document itself. Finally, the `label` command in LaTeX allows us to add a label to the table that we can reference throughout our LaTeX document. It's always better to refer to something like "Table \\ref{tab:ss_basic}" rather than "Table 1a" in your LaTeX document. That way, if the table order changes, the table numbers in your document will update automatically.

By default, LaTeX will include the subsection number in the table number, so you'll get something like "Table 1.1". To drop the subsection number, you can add the following command to your LaTeX preamble: `\renewcommand{\thetable}{\arabic{table}}`.

You'll see that this table contains the sum, mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and observation count for six variables in the census data set. This looks pretty good, but there are some elements that aren't quite right. For example, the table has only one column number for six columns and it contains the number of observations as both a column and row at the bottom. We can clean this up by adding the following options to the `esttab` command in STATA:

*LaTeX*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/table_1b.tex", replace cells("sum mean sd min max count") /// 
booktabs nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label
```

*Word*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/tables.rtf", append /// 
cells("sum mean sd min max count") title("Table 2: Summary statistics - Basic, Clean") /// 
nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label
```

Add this new table to your LaTeX document like this:

![](/img/tab1b.png){fig-alt="table_1b"}
The `vspace{0.5in}` command adds a half inch of blank space between the two tables. It's not necessary, but makes things look better in this case.

Note that for LaTeX, we're creating separate .tex files for Table 1 and Table 2, but for Word, we're creating one .rtf document called "tables" and appending Table 2 to Table 1. In LaTeX, you'll want separate files for each table, but that's not typically something that you'll want in Word. 

Our table is looking better now. We got rid of the column numbering and the extra observation count. But there are still improvements that we could make. For example, suppose that we don't need all these decimal places in each column. We can adjust that by formatting the column output in the `esttab` command as follows. Let's also clean up some of the column names while we're at it:

*LaTeX*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/table_1c.tex", replace /// 
cells("sum(fmt(%8.0fc)) mean(fmt(%8.2fc)) sd(fmt(%8.2fc)) min max count") /// 
booktabs nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label ///
collabels("Sum" "Mean" "SD" "Min" "Max" "Obs")
```

*Word*
```{r eval = False}
esttab using "~/tables.rtf", append /// 
cells("sum(fmt(%8.0fc)) mean(fmt(%8.2fc)) sd(fmt(%8.2fc)) min max count") /// 
title("Table 3: Summary statistics - Basic, Formatted") ///
nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label ///
collabels("Sum" "Mean" "SD" "Min" "Max" "Obs")
```

This looks good, but oftentimes we want summary statistics tables that compare characteristics for a treatment group and a control group. Run the following STATA code that designates certain states in the census data as "treated" states and the others as "control states".

```{r eval = FALSE}
gen treat=1 if inlist(state, "Louisiana", "Texas", "Arkansas", "Mississippi")
replace treat=0 if treat==.
```

Now run the following `estpost` and modified `esttab` commands that will generate a treatment vs. control summary statistics table. Note that, for this table, we'll focus on the mean and the standard deviation of the variables of interest and present the information in the more standard format of estimate over the standard deviation.

```{r eval = FALSE}
est clear
estpost tabstat pop pop65p medage death marriage divorce, by(treat) c(stat) stat(mean sd) nototal
```

*LaTeX*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/table_1d.tex", replace /// 
cells("mean(fmt(%8.2fc))" "sd(par)") /// 
booktabs nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label unstack gap ///
collabels(none) eqlabels("Treatment" "Control")
```

*Word*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/tables.rtf", append /// 
cells("mean(fmt(%8.2fc))" "sd(par)") ///
title("Table 4: Summary statistics - Treat vs. Control") /// 
nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label unstack gap ///
collabels(none) eqlabels("Treatment" "Control")
```

One thing to note here is that we're using `eqlables` rather than `collabels` to add column labels. This is because when we use the `by()` option in the `estpost` command, the STATA output is stacked in one long column. We use the `unstack` option to split the summary statistics by treatment and control groups, and when we do this, STATA treats each column as an "equation". 

Another thing to be aware of is that we're using the `sd(par)` option to put the standard errors in parentheses under the mean values. When we do this, any formatting that we use for the mean (e.g., %8.2fc) is passed on to the standard deviation unless we explicitly select a different formatting option for the standard deviation.  

Now suppose we want to group our summary statistic variables into categories. In this case, we'll use two categories: *Demographics* and *Status*. To do this, we can modify the `esttab` code as follows:

*LaTeX*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/table_1e.tex", replace ///
refcat(pop "\emph{Demographic}" death "\vspace{0.1em} \\ \emph{Status}", nolabel) ///
cells("mean(fmt(%8.2fc))" "sd(par)") /// 
booktabs nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label unstack gap ///
collabels(none) eqlabels("Treatment" "Control")
```

*Word*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/tables.rtf", append ///
refcat(pop "{\i Demographic}" death "\line {\i Status}", nolabel) ///
cells("mean(fmt(%8.2fc))" "sd(par)") ///
title("Table 5: Summary statistics - Treat vs. Control, Grouped") ///  
nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label unstack gap ///
collabels(none) eqlabels("Treatment" "Control")
```

The key to adding the group names is the `refcat` command. The syntax requires us to tell LaTeX or Word the variable name that we want to be directly below the group name (e.g., pop for Demographic). The `\vspace` command in LaTeX and the `\line` command in Word allows us to control the space between the variable groupings in the table.

This looks pretty good, but the spaces between the variables in the table are a little large. We can fix that by replacing the `gaps` option with the `nogaps` option and re-running: 

*LaTeX*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/table_1f.tex", replace ///
refcat(pop "\emph{Demographic}" death "\vspace{0.1em} \\ \emph{Status}", nolabel) ///
cells("mean(fmt(%8.2fc))" "sd(par)") /// 
booktabs nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label unstack nogaps ///
collabels(none) eqlabels("Treatment" "Control")
```

*Word*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/tables.rtf", append ///
refcat(pop "{\i Demographic}" death "\line {\i Status}", nolabel) ///
cells("mean(fmt(%8.2fc))" "sd(par)") ///
title("Table 6: Summary statistics - Treat vs. Control, Spaced") ///
nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label unstack nogaps ///
collabels(none) eqlabels("Treatment" "Control")
```

We're getting pretty close to where we want to be with this table, but it would probably be helpful to readers if we added the number of observations in the treatment and control groups to the table. To do this, we need to save the number of observations for both the treatment and control groups in locals and include those local values in the `stats` option for `esttab`. Run the following STATA code and then see below for the `esttab` modifications:

```{r eval = FALSE}
count if treat == 1
estadd local treat_N = r(N)
count if treat == 0
estadd local control_N = r(N)
```

*LaTeX*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/table_1g.tex", replace ///
refcat(pop "\emph{Demographic}" death "\vspace{0.01in} \\ \emph{Status}", nolabel) ///
cells("mean(fmt(%8.2fc))" "sd(par)") /// 
booktabs nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label unstack nogaps  ///
collabels(none) eqlabels("Treatment" "Control") /// 
stats(treat_N control_N, layout("@ @") labels("Observations"))
```

*Word*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/tables.rtf", append ///
refcat(pop "{\i Demographic}" death "\line {\i Status}", nolabel) ///
cells("mean(fmt(%8.2fc))" "sd(par)") ///
title("Table 7: Summary statistics - Treat vs. Control, Obs") /// 
nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label unstack nogaps ///
collabels(none) eqlabels("Treatment" "Control") /// 
stats(treat_N control_N, layout("@ @") labels("Observations"))
```

Note that this code block should follow the `estpost` command. This code counts the number of observations in the treatment group and stores that number in a local called "treat_N". It does the same thing for the control group and stores the result in a local called "control_N". We then use the `stats` option to include the observation values, the `layout` option to tell LaTeX or Word that we want these observation values to appear in the same row in the table (without this option, LaTeX or Word will put each value in a different row), and the `labels` option tells LaTeX or Word that we want to label this row "Observations".

Sometimes it's helpful to know whether differences in summary statistics across treatment and control groups are statistically different. We can check this by running a series of t-tests and adding the results to the table. This is going to take some extensive modifications to our current code because we'll need to use the `ttest` command instead of the `tabstat` command. This means we'll have to adjust some of our `esttab` code as a result. Run the following STATA code and then see below for the `esttab` modifications: 

```{r eval = FALSE}
global vars pop pop65p medage death marriage divorce

est clear
estpost ttest $vars, by(treat)

count if treat == 1
estadd local treat_N = r(N)
count if treat == 0
estadd local control_N = r(N)
```

*LaTeX*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/table_1h.tex", replace ///
refcat(pop "\emph{Demographic}" death "\vspace{0.01in} \\ \emph{Status}", nolabel) ///
cells("mu_1 mu_2 p(star)") /// 
star(* 0.50 ** 0.20 *** 0.10) ///
booktabs nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label nogaps ///
collabels("Treatment" "Control" "\shortstack{p-Value of\\Difference}") /// 
stats(treat_N control_N, layout("@ @") labels("Observations"))
```

*Word*
```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/tables.rtf", append ///
refcat(pop "{\i Demographic}" death "\line {\i Status}", nolabel) ///
cells("mu_1 mu_2 p(star)") /// 
star(* 0.50 ** 0.20 *** 0.10) ///
title("Table 8: Summary statistics - Treat vs. Control, t-test") /// 
nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label nogaps ///
collabels("Treatment" "Control" "p-Value of Difference") /// 
stats(treat_N control_N, layout("@ @") labels("Observations"))
```

First, we're defining a global called `vars` that includes each of the variables we'll include in our summary statistics table. We're then running a t-test on each variable across the treatment and control groups. Next, we add the observation count for the treatment and control groups just like we did before. We then need to modify our `esttab` code so that the arguments in our `cell` command reflect the names that `ttest` uses (which are different than the names `tabstat` uses). We tell STATA to output two columns of means (one for the treatment group and one for the control group) and the p-value of the difference. The `(star)` option tells STATA that we want stars to represent statistical significance attached to the p-values. We then need to define our significance levels or else STATA will use the default `*p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001`. Notice that I'm defining some pretty strange significance levels in this example. The reason is that there aren't any differences in summary statistics between the treatment and control group where `p<0.10`, so I'm bumping these up so that some stars will appear in the table. The last thing to notice is that we're using `collabels` now instead of `eqlabels`. That's again due to the change from `tabstat` to `ttest`. As a result, I dropped the `unstack` option, which is no longer needed. I also wanted to label the third column "p-Value of Difference", but that was too long for the cell size in LaTeX. So I used the `\shortstack` command along with the double backslashes to add a line break in the column label.

Finally, let's add some footnotes to explain to readers that we're using some strange values to denote statistical significance. 

*LaTeX*
Like table titles, table notes are best added in LaTeX and not through STATA's `esttab` command. There are a few ways to do this, but I like to use the `threeparttable` package in LaTeX. Add the following to your LaTeX preamble:

```{r eval = FALSE}
\usepackage[flushleft]{threeparttable}
```

And then include the following LaTeX code that adds a footnote to the summary statistics table:

![](/img/tab_footnote.png){fig-alt="table_notes"}
*Word*
For Word tables, we can include the footnotes in the `esttab` command by using the `addnotes` option:

```{r eval = FALSE}
esttab using "~/tables.rtf", append ///
refcat(pop "{\i Demographic}" death "\line {\i Status}", nolabel) ///
cells("mu_1 mu_2 p(star)") /// 
star(* 0.50 ** 0.20 *** 0.10) ///
title("Table 8: Summary statistics - Treat vs. Control, t-test") /// 
nonumber nomtitle nonote noobs compress label nogaps ///
collabels("Treatment" "Control" "p-Value of Difference") /// 
stats(treat_N control_N, layout("@ @") labels("Observations")) ///
addnotes("{\i Notes:} The treatment group includes Louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi. The control group includes all other states." "{\i *p<0.50, **p<0.20, ***p<0.10}")
```

That should give you most of the flexibility you'd need to export summary statistics tables directly from STATA to either LaTeX or Word. Now let's take a look at exporting regression tables.

### Regression Tables
