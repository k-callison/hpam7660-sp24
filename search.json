    "text": "Instructor\n\n   Kevin Callison\n   Tidewater 1915\n   kcallison@tulane.edu\n\n\n\nOffice Hours\n\n   Tuesday/Thursday\n   2:15-3:15 PM\n   Tidewater 1915 or Zoom\n\n\n\n\nCourse Details\n\n   Tuesday/Thursday\n   1:00–2:15 PM\n   Tidewater 1202\n\n\n\n\nCourse Descripton\nHPAM 7660 presents an overview of health policy in the United States – its scope, its dynamics, and its conceptual and practical dilemmas. The course is designed to acquaint students with major issues in the policymaking process, specifically in formulating, implementing, and assessing those patterns of government decision. Students will explore the history and structure of the American health care system, as well as explore a policy issue of their choosing using the Bardach analytical method.\n\n\nCourse Materials\nWe will use the following online (and free!) textbook along with various readings that will be posted to the course website under the Assignments tab.\n\nIsmay, Chester and Albert Y. Kim. 2022. Statistical Inference via Data Science: A ModernDive into R and the Tidyverse.\n\nWe’ll use R in this class to conduct data analysis. R is free, open source, and available on all major platforms. RStudio (also free) is a graphical interface to R that is widely used to work with the R language. R is available in all Tulane computer labs and you are encouraged to bring your laptop to class if you’re able to. [Problem Set 0][ps0] will walk you through setting up with R, RStudio, and GitHub.\n\n\nCourse Evaluation\nThe following components and weights will be used to calculate your final grade:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCategory\nPercent of Final Grade\n\n\n\n\nClass participation\n10%\n\n\nReading Discussion Questions & Problem Sets\n40%\n\n\nPolicy Memo\n30%\n\n\nCase Presentation\n20%\n\n\nPeer Assessment\n25%\n\n\n\nPolicy Memo - throughout the semester, you will construct a policy memo to be submitted on the final day of class. The memo should advocate for a policy position of your choice and can be targeted to local leaders (e.g., mayor, city council, etc.), or state or federal legislators. The target audience will depend on the scope of your policy. The final draft of the policy memo should be approximately 8-10 pages, excluding references.\nThe University of Southern California library provides a good guide for writing a policy memo. Note that as the guide states: “You should not approach writing a policy memo in the same way as you would an academic research paper. Yes, there are certain commonalities in how the content is presented [e.g., a well-written problem statement], but the overarching objective of a policy memo is not to discover or create new knowledge. It is focused on providing a pre-determined group of readers the rationale for choosing a particular policy alternative or specific course of action. In this sense, most policy memos possess a component of advocacy and advice intended to promote evidence-based dialog about an issue.” Your policy memo will consist of the following 7 sections, that will be submitted individually throughout the semester before a final version of the memo to be submitted on the last day of class:\n\nExecutive summary\n\nIntroduction and problem definition (Bardach Step 1)\n\nIssue analysis (Bardach Step 2)\n\nProposed solutions (Bardach Steps 3, 4, & 5) \nStrategic recommendations (Bardach Step 6 & Step 7)\n\nConclusion (Bardach Step 8)\n\nReferences\n\n\nPolicy Memo Due Dates:\n\nProblem statement – Feb. 28th \nPreliminary reference list – March 14th \nIntroduction and problem definition draft – March 21st \nIssue analysis draft – March 28th\n\nProposed solutions draft – April 11th \n\nStrategic recommendations draft – April 25th \nExecutive summary and conclusions draft – May 2nd \nFinal draft & Infographic – May 9th \n\nCase Presentation - The case presentation will take place on May 2nd. The case presentation will coincide with a series of panel discussion during our “virtual D.C. experience”. I’ll provide more detail on the schedule and content of these panels on the course website along with a rubric for the case presentations.\nReading Discussion Questions & Problem Sets – Reading discussion questions will be due by class time each Tuesday afternoon and should be submitted through Canvas. I will post the reading discussion questions to Canvas at least a week in advance of the due date.\nPeer Assessment - The peer assessment component of your grade will consist of anonymous grading of your team contribution by the other members of your team (more specific details to follow).\nYour final course grade will be calculated according to the following ranges:\n\n\n\nLetter Grade\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nA\n94% and above\n\n\nA-\n90 to 93.9%\n\n\nB+\n85 to 89.9%\n\n\nB\n80 to 84.9%\n\n\nB-\n75 to 79.9%\n\n\nC\n70 to 74.9%\n\n\nF\n&lt;70%\n\n\n\n\n\nLate Policy\nLate submissions will be given half credit.\n\n\nSPHTM Honor Code\nI expect that you will abide by the school’s Honor Code and Code of Academic Conduct. Failure to do so will result in referral to the Honor Board. I encourage you to discuss the lectures and coursework with your colleagues to facilitate your understanding of the material. But I expect that you will engage in independent scholarship when completing your own work, properly citing external assistance or sources. If you have any questions about these expectations, please refer to the code or ask me in advance.\n\n\nAmericans with Disabilities Act of 1990\nIt is the policy and practice of Tulane University to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (Pub. L. No. 101-336), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Pub. L. No. 93-112, §504, as amended), and state and local requirements regarding individuals with disabilities. Under these laws, no qualified individual with a disability shall be denied access to or participation in services, programs, and activities of Tulane University. Students seeking academic adjustments or accommodations must register their disabilities with the Goldman Center for Student Accessibility.\n\n\nTitle IX\nTulane University recognizes the inherent dignity of all individuals and promotes respect for all people. As such, Tulane is committed to providing an environment free of all forms of discrimination including sexual and gender-based discrimination, harassment, and violence like sexual assault, intimate partner violence, and stalking. If you (or someone you know) has experienced or is experiencing these types of behaviors, know that you are not alone. Resources and support are available: you can learn more here. Any and all of your communications on these matters will be treated as either “Confidential” or “Private” as explained in the chart below. Please know that if you choose to confide in me I am mandated by the university to report to the Title IX Coordinator, as Tulane and I want to be sure you are connected with all the support the university can offer. You do not need to respond to outreach from the university if you do not want to.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConfidential\nPrivate\n\n\n\n\nExcept in extreme circumstances, involving imminent danger to one’s self or others, nothing will be share without your explicit permission.\nConversations are kept as confidential as possible, but information is shared with key staff members so the University can offer resources and accommodations and take action if necessary for safety reasons.\n\n\nCounseling & Psychological Services (CAPS): (504) 314-2277\nCase Management & Victim Support Services (CMVSS): (504) 314-2160\n\n\nStudent Health Center Downtown: (504) 988-6929 Uptown: (504) 865-5255\nTulane University Police (TUPD) Downtown: (504) 988-5531 Uptown: (504) 865-5911\n\n\nSexual Aggression Peer Hotline and Education (SAPHE): (504) 654-9543\nTitle IX Coordinator: (504) 865-5611 or email: titleix@tulane.edu\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Learning Objectives\n\nExhibit a conceptual understanding of the forces and factors accounting for legislation and regulation pertaining to health services.\n\nDevelop a framework to critically discuss and evaluate policy issues affecting the U.S. health care system.\n\nCompare and contrast the public policy objectives of various stakeholders with the realities of the political process.\n\nCritically evaluate the research literature that examines the federal and state roles in health services.\n\nEvaluate current proposals advanced in Congress and by the private sector that impact health services delivery.\n\nDemonstrate a working understanding of the legislative process and the related federal and state regulation processes.\n\n\n\n\nCourse Competencies\nThe Department of Health Policy & Management has adopted a set of competencies for evaluating each of our masters-level programs, including both the MPH in Health Policy and the MHA. Our accrediting bodies ask that we demonstrate, on a course level, which program competencies are supported and developed through this particular course. Some competencies are given more attention in the course activities and materials. The subsections below indicate to what extent each competency is addressed in the course materials, activities, and evaluation process.\nMPH in Health Policy Program Competencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetency\nDegree Covered\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nAnalyze the influence of policy mechanisms on patient and provider behavior and health systems outcomes.\nP\n1,3,5,6,7\n\n\nAssess health systems performance and issues of quality, access, and efficiency.\nR\n1,2,3,5,6,7\n\n\nCritique health policy literature.\nR\n4\n\n\nCommunicate health policy issues written and orally.\nP\n2,3,4\n\n\n\nMHA Program Competencies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompetency\nDegree Covered\nLearning Objectives\n\n\n\n\nSpeak and write in a clear, concise, and logical manner in formal and informal situations within health care settings to convey cogent business presentations and to facilitate a group.

    "text": "Errors pushing to GitHub\nIf you trying to push to GitHub and you get an error saying something like:\n\n/usr/bin/git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/main To https://github.com/gov50-f23/gov-50-hw-2-mattblackwell.git ! [rejected] HEAD -&gt; main (non-fast-forward) error: failed to push some refs to ‘https://github.com/gov50-f23/gov-50-hw-2-mattblackwell.git’ hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g. hint: ‘git pull …’) before pushing again. hint: See the ‘Note about fast-forwards’ in ‘git push –help’ for details.\n\nThis can happen if you edit the repository manually on the GitHub website rather than in your local version. Sometimes you can fix this problem by simply hitting the “Pull” button in RStudio:\n\nIf this solves your problem, great! If you get an error message when trying to pull, then you’ll need to resolve the conflicts manually. First start a new session of RStudio by going to the Session menu and hitting “New Session”:\n\nThis will open a new RStudio window. In this new window, we are going to create a new project from the same repository. When creating this new project, be sure to add _new to the end of the project directory name:\n\nNow you should have two RStudio sessions with two different projects: the original local one and a new one directly from GitHub:\n\nAssuming you want to overwrite whatever is on the GitHub website with what is on you local computer, copy the contents of your Rmd file from the old RStudio project to the same Rmd file in the new RStudio project. In the new RStudio project, knit the Rmd file, commit any changes, and then push to GitHub. Thew new RStudio project should be all synced now.\nOnce you are confident that the new project has all of the changes that you want, simply delete the old RStudio project from your computer."

    "text": "Files larger than 100 MB\nIf you get a push error complaining about files greater than 100 MB, you will need to follow similar steps to the “pull error” steps in the last section. Once you have copied over the contents of your Rmd files, you can then add your data files. For files over 100 MB, you will add them to the the .gitignore file of your new repository. To do this, add the file to your new repository and it will show up in the Git tab. Right-click on the new file in the Git tab and hit the Ignore button:\n\nA dialog box will open and you can hit “Save” which will add or amend a .gitignore file in your repository. You should then stage and commit that .gitignore file and push.\n\nA good practice would be to now write an Rmd file or R script that will load the ignored big data file, subset it to certain rows and columns and then save the file as a csv file using write_csv(). Once you get that csv file to under 100 MB, you can commit that file and use it as the main data file in your main Rmd file."
