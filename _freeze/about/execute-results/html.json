It is designed to acquaint students with major issues involved in formulating, implementing, and assessing patterns of decisions established by government. Because the study of policy is essentially interdisciplinary, readings for the course have been drawn from several fields, including sociology, political science, and economics. Specific areas of consideration will be addressed during the seminar through analysis and discussion of the functions of state and local government and various stakeholder groups that attempt to influence governmental action. \n\n\n### Student Learning Objectives\n\nAfter completing this course, students will be able to do the following:\n1.\tExhibit a conceptual understanding of the forces and factors accounting for legislation and regulation pertaining to health services.\\ \n2.\tDevelop a framework to critically discuss and evaluate policy issues affecting the U.S. health care system.\\ \n3.\tCompare and contrast the public policy objectives of various stakeholders with the realities of the political process.\\ \n4.\tCritically evaluate the research literature that examines the federal and state roles in health services.\\ \n5.\tEvaluate current proposals advanced in Congress and by the private sector that impact health services delivery.\\ \n6.\tDemonstrate a working understanding of the legislative process and the related federal and state regulation processes.\\ \n\n\n### Course Instructors {.staff}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.grid .d-flex .align-items-center}\n\n::: {.g-col-3}\n\n\n![](img/callison_pic.png)\n \n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-9}\n\n    \n  \n- {{< fa user >}} &nbsp; {{< var instructor.name_title >}}\n- {{< fa university >}} &nbsp; {{< var instructor.office >}}\n- {{< fa envelope >}} &nbsp; <a href=\"mailto: kcallison@tulane.edu\">kcallson@tulane.edu</a>\n- {{< fa laptop >}} &nbsp; [Webpage]({{< var instructor.website_url >}})\n\n::: \n\n:::\n\n::: {.grid .d-flex .align-items-center}\n\n::: {.g-col-3}\n\n![](img/kahn_pic.png)\n:::\n\n::: {.g-col-9}\n\n- {{< fa user >}} &nbsp; {{< var instructor.name2 >}}\n- {{< fa envelope >}} &nbsp; <a href=\"mailto: CKahn@FAH.org\">CKahn@FAH.org</a>\n- {{< fa laptop >}} &nbsp; [Webpage]({{< var instructor.website_url2 >}})\n\n::: \n\n:::\n\n### Course Website\nThe formatting of this website and much of the content is derived from Matt Blackwell's Gov 50 course at Harvard University, which he has generously made available for use.\n",
